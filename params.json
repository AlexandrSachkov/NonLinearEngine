I enjoy experimenting with modern game technologies and rendering techniques, and I think that you will find it being reflected in my design.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI hope that some of you will find this project useful. All feedback is highly appreciated. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Versioning</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAll NonLinear Engine versions follow the format stated below:<br/>\r\n<b>[Major Version].[Minor Version].[Interface Version]</b><br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:100%\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n  <td><b>Version</b></td>\r\n  <td><b>Description</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>Major</b></td>\r\n    <td>\r\n    signifies major architectural changes.
