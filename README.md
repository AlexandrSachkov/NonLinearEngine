<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
NonLinear Engine is a completely free open-source 3D game and simulation engine for Windows.
The goal of this project is to create a very fast, stable, and highly customizable platform that provides a solid foundation to independent game developers and hobbyists for their games. 
</p>

<p>
I started this project as a means to practice what I am passionate about which is game and graphics development. I enjoy experimenting with modern game technologies and rendering techniques, and I think that you will find it being reflected in my design.
</p>

I hope that some of you will find this project useful. All feedback is highly appreciated.
